# ML Algo Playground

Single-file implementations of machine learning algorithms using PyTorch only.

## Usage

If you want to try the code, you should directly copy-paste the file, since they all stand alone without internal or external dependencies except for `torch` and `numpy`. The implementations are not mature as I lack necessary academic background to fully understand those papers and deep learning frameworks. The plan is to implement the four algorithms below from scratch. However, school workload is heavy, I do not know when I can get these done.
